# InventorySystemProject

<p>Demo of a simple inventory management system completed for a school project. Users can add/modify/delete parts from inventory as well as products.
All user input is validated (fields cannot be empty, text cannot be entered into fields which require numbers, etc).</p>
<p><b>Future Enchancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Creation of parts and products should be abstracted to their own "factory" class</li>
  <li>An enumeration class should be implemented to keep track of the different types of parts (enum classes were considered outside the scope
  of this project by the class syllabus)</li>
  <li>Currently values are hardcoded into their respective classes but a database access layer should be 
  implemented to get values from a relational database.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Technologies Used:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Java 17.0.8</li>
  <li>JavaFX</li>
  <li>IntelliJ IDE</li>
  <li>Javadoc</li>
</ul>
